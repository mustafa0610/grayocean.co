	<h3>About us</h3>

	<h6>
		Our goal is to provide a platform for independent creators while taking care of the commerce, analytics and other tasks that creators deal with while uploading content online, allowing them to focus solely on making content
	</h6>
	<br>
	<h3>Our content policy</h3>
	<h6>
		We believe in freedom of speech as long as it is not hateful, we support in fact promote thought provoking content provided it doesn‚Äôt spread misinformation or isn't hateful to any community or individual in any way. Unpopular opinions just portray the different ways in which a situation can be viewed and is not against our terms. Stirring up conspiracies too, counts as being creative.
	</h6>
	<br>
	<h3>What can I post?</h3>
	<h6>
		We do not want to tell the users what they can and can't post. However, we do provide some guidelines.
		<br>

1. Your face, or your body doesn't qualify as content. If you post a picture of yourself, we will send you a warning, and the revenue generated by that post will be sent to a random charity, and you will receive an acknowledgement for that. Three warnings and we will suspend your posting ability; however, you will still receive the revenue generated by the content you‚Äôve already posted. If you wish that the people who follow your work know what you look like, you can provide references to other social media platforms where they can find you, in the description of your profile. (You can however, post pictures of yourself if the pictures are in the form of a travel blog or any other kind of blog or a beauty tutorial etc. The condition is that it should have creative or informative content along with it)
<br>
2. This is more of a suggestion than it is a compulsion. Please post material entirely made by you. You can post material that makes a good case for fair use, but that will get legal authorities involved, and that isn't in anyone's best interest(Our platform is new, and it would be really helpful if our creators don‚Äôt get us sued. ). Since the EU is making an exception for memes, posting memes is fine as long as they aren't plagiarized, if a meme is reported (and is later confirmed by moderators) to be stolen the person who posted it as their own will get a warning, and the revenue will be transferred to the creator of the meme. Three warnings will result in the creator losing his ability to post new content. (however still receiving revenue generated from previous posts), The same rule applies to all other content.
	</h6>
<br>
<h3>Earning with us  </h3>
<h6>

	Now for the part you probably want to read üòÇüòÇ, <br>

We want to help creators monetize their material, but to do that we need to make sure the content uploaded is created solely by the creator (or qualifies for fair use). We need to ensure the content hasn‚Äôt been plagiarized, or the content doesn‚Äôt comprise of any material owned by someone else. To be certain about that (at least temporarily), we verify who gets to post content on our website. <br>

Currently we plan on using google ads, as our platform is yet in its infancy, however we do plan on getting advertisers specifically for our platform in the not so distant future (*fingers crossed*).

<br>

Now, for the how much will I earn part. You‚Äôll be paid 80% of the Google AdSense your posts generate. <I>But why 80% when I'm the one doing all the creative work? </I> we hear you ask. 20% of the income you generate will go towards site maintenance/upgrading, commerce, to draw in advertisers, and make an advertising system which will display ads relevant to the user, while ensuring they get their right to privacy. Which means initially you will only make 54.4% of the overall ‚Äúad money‚Äù (after removing googles 32%, and our 20 % of the remaining 68%. I.e. 13.6%), but we promise to try our best to get direct ads ASAP, those ads will give you 80% of the ‚Äúad money‚Äù.  <br>

However, we do want to warn you about our policy towards advertisers. After hearing the opinions of creators from other platforms, we have decided to show a bit of hostility towards "The big companies‚Äù when selling ad slots. This means, most of the people who will advertise with us will be small companies, artists, game developers etc. (* at least we hope so *). So, there won't be many fancy ads on your content; however, you will have more freedom while creating your content. <br>

 If any of your posts are reported as hateful, the revenue generated from that post will be sent to a charity that takes care of the community, towards which you were hateful, e.g. the revenue from a post hateful towards the Asian community will go to a charity for Asian people (*******the charities we donate to will be mentioned at the end of the page) <b>. However, the use of offensive or dark humor is not condemned as long as the intention of the creator isn't to promote hate, however, if the post is reported it will be reviewed by our moderators who come from various backgrounds and are creators themselves. </b>
